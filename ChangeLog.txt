DATE
Version 3.9
- Revised documentation.
- '-h' prints flags in case-folded alphabetical order.
- If config file variables are missing, the list is printed to
  the user in config file order.
- Fixed a bug where info dirs weren't getting moved from
  /usr/share to /usr.
- ERRORACTION now also has the effect of determining whether
  mkslack is being run interactively - if so, mkslack will
  prompt the user to continue when printing output so the user
  can take their time reading it.
- The slack-desc template was renamed to template-slack-desc.
- Minor tweaks (mostly whitespace) to some template files.
- Fixed a bug where md5sum values would sometimes be written
  to the MD5SUM_x86_64 .info field or not at all rather than
  to the MD5SUM field. If MD5SUM_x86_64 is actually required,
  this will need to be manually moved to that field.
- Removed '...' placeholder in generated slack-desc (no-space
  variant of dive's 4.0)
- Fixed problem with doinst.sh not being re-initialized in
  some cases (commented variant of dive's 4.0)

Version 3.3rc1
Incorporated slakmagik's nice, new code.
-r is now -b (for build)
A new -V for version check.
With -b you get the choice of having a failed build fixed and
rebuilt. Mostly for manpage/info errors. A new config option
ERRORACTION to do this, which can be PROMPT, AUTO or EXIT.
Now config file errors are reported back.
Now TAG _must_ have a preceding underscore, which keeps it in
line with slackbuilds.

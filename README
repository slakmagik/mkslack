NAME
       mkslack - a SlackBuild generator

SYNOPSIS
       mkslack [options] archive

DESCRIPTION
       Mkslack is a slackbuild generator which uses templates stored in /usr/
       share/mkslack/templates and a configuration file, /etc/mkslack/
       mkslack.conf, which you must edit to use your name, email, etc.

   Idea for use:
       Create a directory, download the archive of a package into it, and run
       mkslack on it. The initial slackbuild and info file are built by this
       script and, when a test build/install is done and working, the files
       should be tweaked by hand. Especially don't forget to fill in the rest
       of the details in the info file. One thing to point out is that
       mkslack will overwrite these files if run again unless you keep the
       default ``KEEPBACKUPS="YES"'' in the configuration file.

       This is only a starter kit!  You ARE expected to edit the created files
       by hand afterwards to remove unnecessary parts or add anything missing!

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print the usage message to standard output.

       -b, --build
              Run the SlackBuild after creation. Got root?

       -i, --install
              Install the package after running mkslack.

       -v, --version
              Print the version of mkslack to standard output.

       -V, --ckver
              Check for a new version of mkslack. (Requires finger(1) and
              internet access.)

   Configuration File Variables
       NAME and EMAIL should be set to what should appear in the SlackBuild
       and info files. They default to empty strings and must be set to non-
       empty strings.

       TAG  should  be  set  to  your  custom  tag  (if  any).  It defaults to
       ``_SBo''.

       KEEPBACKUPS may be set to ``YES'' or ``NO''.  If set to ``YES'', up  to
       5 backups of SlackBuilds and other files will be kept. The higher the
       number, the older they are. It defaults to ``YES''.

       ERRORACTION specifies what to do on build errors caused  by  non-Slack-
       ware-standard man or info pages and may be set to ``PROMPT'', ``AUTO'',
       or ``EXIT''. If set to ``AUTO'' or set to ``PROMPT'' and answering
       ``y'' to the resulting prompt, mkslack will adjust the SlackBuild to
       try to move the man and/or info pages from /usr/share/man to /usr/man
       and will rebuild. If set to ``EXIT'' or set to ``PROMPT'' and answer-
       ing ``n'', mkslack will exit. It defaults to ``PROMPT''.

   Command Line Variables
       DOCS, BUILD, ARCH, and TAG can all be adjusted at runtime by prefixing
       an assignment to one or more of these variables on mkslack's command
       line.

       DOCS can adjust the list of documents in the top level  of  the  source
       tree. For example:

              DOCS=SomeFile mkslack archive

       This  will  add  ``SomeFile''  to  the  list.  For the default, see the
       assignment in mkslack, itself. Depending on mkslack's location and
       your privileges, you may also edit the DOCS list there. Any docs that
       aren't found will be removed from the list.

       BUILD can be used to increment the build number.  If it is not set,  it
       defaults to 1.

       ARCH  can be manually assigned.  It defaults to the auto-detected value
       of the architecture mkslack is running under.

       TAG can also be used to assign  any  value  desired.   It  defaults  to
       ``_SBo''.

mkslack - a SlackBuild generator script
(C) David Woodfall 2010

This slackbuild generator uses templates stored in /usr/share/mkslack/templates
and a config file /etc/mkslack/mkslack.conf which you must edit for name, 
email, copyright etc.

Idea for use:

The initial slackbuild and info file are built by this script, and when
a test build/install is done and working, the files should be tweaked by
hand. Especially don't forget to fill in the rest of the details in the
.info. One thing to point out is that mkslack will overwrite these files
if run again unless you set KEEPBACKUPS="YES" in the conf (default).

This is only a starter kit! You ARE expected to edit the created files
by hand afterwards to remove unnecesary parts!

Syntax:

mkslack [options] <archive>

Options:
-h --help		Usage.
-r --run		Run SlackBuild after creation. Got root?
-i --install	Install the package after running.
-l --list		Pipe archive contents to /usr/bin/most and exit.
-v --version	Version of mkslack.

The documents list in top level of source tree can be adjusted by command:
DOCS="SomeFile" mkslack <archive>
This will add 'SomeFile' to the list. You can also edit the DOCS list in
this script. Any that it doesn't find will be removed from the list.

Build can be specified by:
BUILD=2 mkslack <archive>
Otherwise it defaults to 1.

ARCH can be specified by:
ARCH=xxx mkslack <archive>
It defaults to i486 the same as a regular SlackBuild.

mkslack - a SlackBuild generator script
(C) David Woodfall 2010

This slackbuild generator uses templates stored in /usr/share/mkslack/templates
which you can edit for copyright.

mkslack reads /etc/mkslack/mkslack.conf for name and email address. You
should therefore edit this file.

The slackbuild template is based on the one at slackbuilds.org and
shouldn't be changed too much apart from the aforementioned. In particular
the lines for man and info pages and <documentation> should not be edited
as the script will look for those lines to be exactly the same, and if not
needed, delete them.

The PRGNAM, VERSION, ARCHIVE recognition is very loosely done. It can find
standard source archives which can be .tar.gz .tar.bz2 or .tgz. If you have
a source archive with a '-' in the version number then mkslack will be
borked. In this case you can still use mkslack to build the slackbuild,
but you must edit it by hand before running it.

Idea for use:

The initial slackbuild and info file are built by this script, and when
a test build/install is done and working, the files should be tweaked by
hand. Especially don't forget to fill in the rest of the details in the
.info. One thing to point out is that mkslack will overwrite these files
if run again unless you set KEEPBACKUPS="YES" in the conf (default).

This is only a starter kit! You ARE expected to edit the created files
by hand afterwards to remove unnecesary parts!

Syntax:

mkslack [options] <archive>

Options:
-h | --help	Usage.
-b | --build	Build the package with the SlackBuild. Got root?
-i | --install	Install the package after building (implies -b).
-v | --version	Version of mkslack.
-V | --ckver	Check for an updated version.

The documents list in top level of source tree can be adjusted by command:
DOCS="SomeFile" mkslack <archive>
This will add 'SomeFile' to the list. You can also edit the DOCS list in
this script. Any that it doesn't find will be removed from the list.

Build can be specified by:
BUILD=2 mkslack <archive>
Otherwise it defaults to 1.

ARCH can be specified by:
ARCH=xxx mkslack <archive>
It defaults to i486 the same as a regular SlackBuild.

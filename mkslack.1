.SH NAME
\fBmkslack \fP- a SlackBuild generator
\fB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
\fBmkslack\fP [options] <\fIarchive\fP>
.fam T
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This slackbuild generator uses templates stored in /usr/share/mkslack/templates
and a config file /etc/mkslack/mkslack.conf which you must edit for name, 
email, etc.
.PP
Idea for use:
.PP
The initial slackbuild and info file are built by this script, and when
a test build/install is done and working, the files should be tweaked by
hand. Especially don't forget to fill in the rest of the details in the
info. One thing to point out is that mkslack will overwrite these files
if run again unless you set KEEPBACKUPS="YES" in the conf (default).
.PP
This is only a starter kit! You ARE expected to edit the created files
by hand afterwards to remove unnecesary parts!

KEEPBACKUPS="YES|NO" up to 5 backups of SlackBuild and other files are
kept. The higher the number, the older they are.
ERRORACTION="PROMPT|AUTO|EXIT" what to do on build errors. Using AUTO or 
answering 'y' to the prompt will have the slackbuild adjusted for man and
info pages and then rebuilt.

The documents list in top level of source tree can be adjusted by command:
DOCS="SomeFile" \fBmkslack\fP <\fIarchive\fP>
This will add 'SomeFile' to the list. You can also edit the DOCS list in
this script. Any that it doesn't find will be removed from the list.
